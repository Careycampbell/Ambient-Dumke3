The directory `driftDrones` should contain the following audio files:

- driftingC.wav
- driftingDflat.wav
- driftingF.wav

Since you mentioned that there are additional audio files indicated by the ellipsis, I will provide the contents for the existing files as placeholders. If you have specific audio files to include, please replace the placeholders with the actual audio files.

Here are the contents for the files in the `driftDrones` directory:

driftingC.wav: [Audio file for the note C0]
driftingDflat.wav: [Audio file for the note C#0]
driftingF.wav: [Audio file for the note G1]

The remaining files can be added as needed. If you need specific audio files or further details, please provide that information.
